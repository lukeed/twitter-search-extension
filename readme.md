# Trim Twitter Search Results

> Chrome extension that hides the predictive text results in Twitter's search bar.

When performing a search on Twitter, you may have encountered the annoying experience wherein you've typed your query string and are about to click a result, only to be interrupted by Twitter's equivalent of "Did you mean?" >.<

This extension hides the lazy-loaded list of predictive / "helpful" text. You'll never misclick a search result again! :tada:
